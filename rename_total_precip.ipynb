    "This notebook is used to rename the variable name in the total_precip files for the PD and future CPM simulations (i.e. once rain + snow are combined in bash scripts in /data/users/hgilmour/cold_core_filtering). This combining process saves the data varaible fot total precip as \"__data_array_variable__\" . When regridding this to the 10km IMERG grid, iris doesn't recognise this as a name and so it needs to be renamed. This notebook renames \"__data_array_variable__\" as \"unknown\" so that iris recognises it for regridding. It is then saved as 'renamed.....'. \n",
